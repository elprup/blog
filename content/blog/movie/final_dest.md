Who's the next?

This movie is very successful in make a sense of a uncertain happen. We all know that the sense of fearing comes from uncertain and unfamiliar. So we'll fear death, fear future. The movie just amplify the sense. When Alex found out the design, he thought that he could control the whole thing. But at the end, all the things seemed followed the rules, not the design. That makes the design, but not the design.

From another view, the movie seems to be a group of accident. The sentence said by the doctor is very interesting: when death comes to you, there is no accident. 

It seems that the terriry movies just let us feel a sense of danger, and then we can make better use of everyday.

We need the intense sense.
