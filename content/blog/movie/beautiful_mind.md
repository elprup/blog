Nash: Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment? I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data. 
Alicia: ......(laugh)
Alicia: I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance. 
Alicia: A proof...Er...Empirical data? OK.
Alicia: Well, How big is the universe? 
Nash: Infinite. 
Alicia: How do you know? 
Nash: I know because all the data indicates it's infinite. 
Alicia: But it hasn't been proven yet. 
Nash: No. 
Alicia: You haven't seen it. 
Nash: No. 
Alicia: How do you know for sure? 
Nash: I don't, I just believe it. 
Alicia: En, It's the same with love I guess.
