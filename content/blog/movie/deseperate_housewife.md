Gabrielle: Well, you've won.
Calos: What did I win?
Gabrielle: Bill and I split up.
Calos: Can't say I'm surprised.
Calos: He wasn't right for you.
Gabrielle: I know. So just admit you sent the flowers.
Calos: I didn'T.
Gabrielle: Carlos, just tell me. I won't be mad.I promise.
Calos: Gaby, if I was gonna send you flowers, I wouldn't send you pink roses. I'd send you white orchids,because I know they're your favorite.And if I wanted to cheer you up-sunflowers. And for the flu...blue irises.
Gabrielle: I hate that you know me so well, and it took so long for that to happen. Now I have to start over again with somebody else.
Calos:  Yeah. That's what dating's for.
Gabrielle: I know, and it sucks. I mean, you saw me. I went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can. It was horrible.
Calos: well, if it makes you feel any better, I dragged to the ballet the other night.
Gabrielle: So you are dating. That's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.
Calos: Well, if you wanna bag the big game, gotta work on the guns.
Gabrielle: I'll give you this--you're gonna be a tough act to follow, carlos.
Calos: Back at yard, babe.
